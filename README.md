Components from: https://github.com/GroceriStar/pdf-export-component

install
- [x] @groceristar/pdf-export


- [ ] When things will be tested and styles and stuff working well - everytrhing should be moved into npm component. right now it's have to understand that we have an up-to-date version at npm.

- [ ] Recipe should have white background. And content/description please split into few sentences by "." so it'll look better. Also can be added some spacing. Nothing fancy - just to make it looking not so ugly.

- [ ] Check, didn't our bug was gone with updated version of pdf-render?

- [ ] publish a new version with DocLayouts inside and replace them here. should work or not? Where is the latest version?
